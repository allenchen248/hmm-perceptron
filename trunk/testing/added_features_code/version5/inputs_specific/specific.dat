West 
Indian 
_RARE_ 
Phil 
_location_ 
took 
four 
for 
38 
on 
Friday 
as 
Leicestershire 
beat 
Somerset 
by 
an 
innings 
and 
39 
runs 
in 
two 
days 
to 
take 
over 
at 
the 
head 
of 
the 
county 
championship 
. 

Their 
stay 
on 
top 
, 
though 
, 
may 
be 
_RARE_ 
as 
title 
rivals 
Essex 
, 
_location_ 
and 
Surrey 
all 
closed 
in 
on 
victory 
while 
Kent 
made 
up 
for 
lost 
time 
in 
their 
_RARE_ 
match 
against 
Nottinghamshire 
. 

After 
_RARE_ 
Somerset 
out 
for 
83 
on 
the 
opening 
morning 
at 
_firstCaps_ 
_firstCaps_ 
, 
Leicestershire 
extended 
their 
first 
innings 
by 
_startNumerals_ 
runs 
before 
being 
bowled 
out 
for 
_startNumerals_ 
with 
England 
_RARE_ 
Andy 
_location_ 
taking 
three 
for 
83 
. 

_location_ 
by 
_startNumerals_ 
, 
Somerset 
got 
a 
_RARE_ 
start 
to 
their 
second 
innings 
before 
_location_ 
stepped 
in 
to 
_RARE_ 
them 
out 
for 
_startNumerals_ 
. 

Essex 
, 
however 
, 
look 
certain 
to 
_RARE_ 
their 
top 
spot 
after 
_firstCaps_ 
Hussain 
and 
Peter 
_firstCaps_ 
gave 
them 
a 
firm 
_RARE_ 
on 
their 
match 
against 
Yorkshire 
at 
Headingley 
. 

Hussain 
, 
considered 
surplus 
to 
England 
's 
one-day 
_RARE_ 
, 
struck 
_startNumerals_ 
, 
his 
first 
championship 
century 
of 
the 
season 
, 
as 
Essex 
reached 
_startNumerals_ 
and 
took 
a 
first 
innings 
lead 
of 
82 
. 

By 
the 
close 
Yorkshire 
had 
turned 
that 
into 
a 
_startNumerals_ 
advantage 
but 
_RARE_ 
_firstCaps_ 
had 
_RARE_ 
their 
hopes 
, 
taking 
four 
for 
24 
in 
48 
balls 
and 
leaving 
them 
_RARE_ 
on 
_startNumerals_ 
for 
five 
and 
_RARE_ 
for 
rain 
. 

At 
the 
Oval 
, 
Surrey 
captain 
Chris 
Lewis 
, 
another 
man 
_RARE_ 
by 
England 
, 
continued 
to 
_RARE_ 
his 
critics 
as 
he 
followed 
his 
four 
for 
45 
on 
Thursday 
with 
80 
not 
out 
on 
Friday 
in 
the 
match 
against 
Warwickshire 
. 

He 
was 
well 
backed 
by 
England 
_RARE_ 
Mark 
_location_ 
who 
made 
70 
as 
Surrey 
closed 
on 
_startNumerals_ 
for 
seven 
, 
a 
lead 
of 
_startNumerals_ 
. 

_location_ 
kept 
up 
the 
hunt 
for 
their 
first 
championship 
title 
since 
_startNumerals_ 
by 
_RARE_ 
Worcestershire 
to 
_startNumerals_ 
for 
five 
in 
their 
second 
innings 
, 
still 
100 
runs 
away 
from 
_RARE_ 
an 
innings 
defeat 
. 

After 
the 
_RARE_ 
of 
_RARE_ 
the 
opening 
day 
of 
their 
match 
badly 
affected 
by 
the 
weather 
, 
Kent 
stepped 
up 
a 
_RARE_ 
to 
_RARE_ 
Nottinghamshire 
for 
_startNumerals_ 
. 

They 
were 
held 
up 
by 
a 
_RARE_ 
_startNumerals_ 
from 
Paul 
Johnson 
but 
_RARE_ 
fast 
_RARE_ 
Martin 
_firstCaps_ 
took 
four 
for 
55 
. 

By 
_RARE_ 
Kent 
had 
reached 
108 
for 
three 
.

LONDON 
1996-08-30 

The

_RARE_ 
_RARE_ 
Alan 
_location_ 
was 
named 
as 
the 
new 
England 
captain 
on 
Friday 
. 

The 
_startNumerals_ 
, 
who 
joined 
Newcastle 
for 
15 
million 
pounds 
sterling 
( 
$ 
_startNumerals_ 
million 
) 
, 
takes 
over 
from 
Tony 
Adams 
, 
who 
led 
the 
side 
during 
the 
European 
championship 
in 
June 
, 
and 
former 
captain 
David 
_firstCaps_ 
. 

Adams 
and 
_firstCaps_ 
are 
both 
injured 
and 
will 
miss 
England 
's 
opening 
World 
Cup 
qualifier 
against 
Moldova 
on 
Sunday 
. 

_location_ 
takes 
the 
_RARE_ 
on 
a 
trial 
basis 
, 
but 
new 
coach 
_firstCaps_ 
_firstCaps_ 
said 
he 
saw 
no 
reason 
why 
the 
former 
Blackburn 
and 
Southampton 
_RARE_ 
should 
not 
make 
the 
post 
his 
own 
. 

" 
I 
'm 
sure 
there 
wo 
n't 
be 
a 
problem 
, 
I 
'm 
sure 
Alan 
is 
the 
man 
for 
the 
job 
, 
" 
_firstCaps_ 
said 
. 

" 
There 
were 
three 
or 
four 
people 
who 
could 
have 
done 
it 
but 
when 
I 
spoke 
to 
Alan 
he 
was 
up 
for 
it 
and 
really 
wanted 
it 
. 

" 
In 
four 
days 
it 
's 
very 
difficult 
to 
come 
to 
a 
100 
percent 
_RARE_ 
about 
something 
like 
this 
... 

but 
he 
_RARE_ 
how 
to 
_RARE_ 
himself 
, 
his 
team 
_RARE_ 
respect 
him 
and 
he 
_RARE_ 
about 
the 
team 
situation 
even 
though 
he 
plays 
up 
front 
.

_location_

striking 
partner 
_firstCaps_ 
_location_ 
withdrew 
from 
the

with 
an

replaced 
by

Wimbledon 
_RARE_ 
MaliVai 
Washington 
and 
Marcelo 
Rios 
were 
not 
so 
_RARE_ 
on 
a 
night 
of 
_RARE_ 
at 
the 
U.S. 
Open 
. 

The 
_startNumerals_ 
Washington 
fell 
short 
of 
_RARE_ 
his 
Wimbledon 
_RARE_ 
_RARE_ 
as 
he

_RARE_ 
_RARE_ 
Alex 
O'Brien 
6-3

. 

_firstCaps_ 
_RARE_ 
on 
the 
_RARE_ 
, 
10th 
seed 
Rios 
lost 
to 
another 
player 
with 
a 
Wimbledon 
connection 
-- 
bad 
boy 
Jeff 
_location_ 
. 

The 
_RARE_ 
_RARE_ 
defeated 
the 
_location_ 
6-4 
4-6 
7-6 
6-2 
. 

The 
day 
programme 
went 
_RARE_ 
although 
_RARE_ 
former 
champion 
Agassi 
had 
to 
_RARE_ 
out 
of 
a 
dangerous 
3-6 
_startNumerals_ 
_RARE_ 
, 
winning 
18 
of 
the 
last 
19 
games 
against 
India 
's 
_location_ 
_firstCaps_ 
. 

But 
the 
night 
_RARE_ 
to 
the 
_RARE_ 
. 

Washington 
, 
who 
climbed 
back 
from 
a 
_startNumerals_ 
deficit 
, 
two 
sets 
down 
in 
the 
third 
set 
against 
Todd 
Martin 
in 
the 
Wimbledon 
_RARE_ 
, 
looked 
_RARE_ 
for 
another 
_RARE_ 
_RARE_ 
. 

O'Brien 
, 
a 
winner 
two 
weeks 
ago 
in 
New 
_firstCaps_ 
for 
his 
first 
_RARE_ 
title 
, 
served 
for 
the 
match 
at 
_startNumerals_ 
in 
the 
third 
set 
before 
Washington 
came 
_RARE_ 
back 
. 

" 
I 
just 
kept 
saying 
to 
_RARE_ 
, 
' 
keep 
giving 
_RARE_ 
the 
best 
chance 
to 
win 
, 
keep 
_RARE_ 
, 
maybe 
something 
will 
happen 
, 
' 
" 
said 
the 
_startNumerals_ 
O'Brien 
, 
ranked 
_startNumerals_ 
. 

" 
I 
kept 
my 
_RARE_ 
and 
I 
was 
_RARE_ 
of 
_RARE_ 
for 
that 
-- 
_RARE_ 
I 
would 
have 
_RARE_ 
up 
the 
_RARE_ 
and 
gone 
home 
. 
" 

The 
_RARE_ 
O'Brien 
, 
a 
former 
U.S. 
_RARE_ 
national 
champion 
, 
fired 
up 
17 
_RARE_ 
to 
_RARE_ 
_RARE_ 
the 
_RARE_ 
Washington 
. 

The 
fifth 
set 
stayed 
on 
serve 
until 
the 
sixth 
game 
, 
when 
Washington 
, 
after 
_RARE_ 
one 
break 
point 
with 
a 
_RARE_ 
winner 
down 
the 
line 
, 
_RARE_ 
a 
_RARE_ 
to 
give 
O'Brien 
a 
4-2 
lead 
. 

The 
_firstCaps_ 
_RARE_ 
in 
two 
_RARE_ 
to 
hold 
serve 
at 
5-2 
and 
then 
_RARE_ 
his 
eighth 
match 
point 
for 
victory 
when 
Washington 
found 
the 
net 
with 
another 
_RARE_ 
from 
_startNumerals_ 
. 

" 
You 
just 
_RARE_ 
of 
keep 
fighting 
and 
you 
keep 
trying 
to 
make 
him 
play 
a 
little 
bit 
. 

I 
think 
he 
got 
a 
little 
tight 
at 
a 
couple 
of 
_RARE_ 
, 
" 
said 
Washington 
. 
" 

But 
I 
think 
he 
served 
pretty 
well 
when 
he 
had 
to 
. 
" 

_location_ 
, 
whose 
Wimbledon 
_RARE_ 
two 
years 
ago 
brought 
him

_RARE_ 
output 
, 
with 
net 
profit 
rising 
by 
33 
percent 
to 
_startNumerals_ 
billion 
lei 
. 

But 
the 
company 
complained 
inflation 
and 
the 
_RARE_ 
high 
rate 
of 
the 
_RARE_ 
cut 
profit 
margins 
on 
exports 
, 
keeping 
profits 
well 
below 
its 
forecast 
of 
_startNumerals_ 
billion 
lei 
. 

_firstCaps_ 
's 
_RARE_ 
output 
rose 
to 
_startNumerals_ 
tonnes 
of 
equipment 
from 
_startNumerals_ 
tonnes 
in 
the 
equivalent 
period 
in 
1995 
, 
the 
company 
report 
to 
the 
Bucharest

exchange 
showed

" 
In 
the

six 
months 
of 
1996 
we 
_RARE_ 
on 
increasing 
the 
volume 
of 
our 
output

exports 
in 
_RARE_ 
and 
_RARE_

" 
the 
report 
said 
. 

From 
January 
to 
June 
_firstCaps_ 
_RARE_ 
59 
percent 
of 
its 
output 
, 
up 
from 
_startNumerals_ 
percent 
in 
the 
same 
period 
last 
year 
. 

The 
company 
said 
higher 
than 
_RARE_ 
inflation 
and 
rising 
_RARE_ 
materials 
and 
wage 
costs 
also 
hit 
profits 
. 

_firstCaps_ 
inflation 
, 
initially 
estimated 
at 
20 
percent 
in 
December 
, 
was 
_startNumerals_ 
percent 
in 
June 
, 
higher 
than 
a 
revised 
_RARE_ 
forecast 
of 
30 
percent 
. 

The 
12 
month 
figure 
_RARE_

percent 
in

The 
_RARE_ 
currency 
has 
slipped 
only 
_RARE_

, 
and 
is 
currently 
quoted 
at 
an 
official

well

CHICAGO 
1996-08-30 

U.S. 
debt 
futures 
finished 
a 
_RARE_ 
_RARE_ 
session 
sharply 
lower 
, 
as 
the 
markets 
were 
_RARE_ 
by 
a 
stronger 
than 
expected 
rise 
in 
the 
August 
National 
Association 
of 
_location_ 
_location_ 
( 
_AllCaps_ 
) 
index 
for 
the 
Chicago 
area 
, 
traders 
and 
analysts 
said 
. 

The 
August 
Chicago 
_AllCaps_ 
rose 
_startNumerals_ 
points 
to 
_startNumerals_ 
, 
its 
highest 
level 
since 
_startNumerals_ 
in 
February 
1995 
and 
the 
largest 
monthly 
rise 
since 
December 
1993 
. 

_location_ 
dealers 
immediately 
sold 
_location_ 
and 
bond 
futures 
, 
after 
the 
market 
on 
average 
was 
_RARE_ 
the 
index 
to 
rise 
_RARE_ 
to 
_startNumerals_ 
from 
July 
's 
_startNumerals_ 
. 

Traders 
also 
said 
Japanese 
investors 
were 
_RARE_ 
long 
_location_ 
futures 
/ 
short 
_RARE_ 
, 
and 
that 
heavy 
put 
buying 
helped 
pressure 
_location_ 
to 
lower 
levels 
before 
the 
close 
. 

One 
U.S. 
firm 
bought 
_startNumerals_ 
September 
_startNumerals_ 
_RARE_ 
put 
options 
at 
a 
strike 
price 
of 
_startNumerals_ 
to 
_startNumerals_ 
in 
the 
last 
two 
_RARE_ 
, 
while 
a 
French 
firm 
bought 
4,000 
September 
_startNumerals_ 
to 
_startNumerals_ 
put 
_RARE_ 
. 

" 
_firstCaps_ 
before 
the 
data 
came 
out 
, 
we 
were 
_RARE_ 
put 
buying 
, 
" 
one 
_RARE_ 
trader 
said 
. 

_location_ 
, 
funds 
were 
_RARE_ 
good 
_RARE_ 
of 
five-year 
_RARE_ 
. 

_firstCaps_ 
_RARE_ 
that 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
was 
buying 
five-year 
_RARE_ 
, 
and 
that 
a 
_RARE_ 
_RARE_ 
fund 
manager 
was 
buying 
_startNumerals_ 
_RARE_ 
in 
the 
cash 
markets 
. 

However 
, 
December 
_firstCaps_ 
ended 
below 
a 
major 
_RARE_ 
level 
at 
_startNumerals_ 
, 
as 
the 
yield 
in 
the 
cash 
bond 
market 
set 
its 
highest 
monthly 
close 
since 
April 
1995 
at 
_startNumerals_ 
percent 
, 
one 
analyst 
said 
. 

December 
bonds 
_RARE_ 
through 
the 
July 
30 
low 
of 
_startNumerals_ 
, 
even 
though 
conditions 
were 
slightly 
_RARE_ 
, 
traders 
said 
. 

The 
December 
_RARE_ 
_RARE_ 
continued 
to 
_RARE_ 
, 
also 
_RARE_ 
the 
market 
's 
fear 
of 
rising 
inflation 
. 

While 
the 
market 
continues 
to 
_RARE_ 
higher 
U.S. 
interest 
rates 
, 
there 
was 
little 
_RARE_ 
to 
the 
_RARE_ 
that 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
would 
_RARE_ 
rates 
before 
the 
next 
Federal 
Open 
_firstCaps_ 
Committee 
meeting 
on

24 
.

governor 
_location_ 
_location_ 
, 
speaking 
on

_RARE_ 
television 
network 
_AllCaps_ 
, 
said 
the 
U.S. 
economy 
appears 
on 
balance 
to 
be 
a 
bit 
strong 
, 
adding 
the 
central 
bank 
would 
not 
_RARE_ 
growth 
provided 
inflation 
_RARE_ 
in 
check 
. 

Earlier 
in

, 
_firstCaps_ 
chairman 
Alan

said 
at

_location_

's 
decision 
to 
_RARE_ 
a 
_RARE_ 
_RARE_ 
at 
the 
July 
_AllCaps_

has 
cast 
more 
_RARE_ 
on

"

Iraqi 
_RARE_ 
of 
Sudanese 
jet 
charged 
with 
_RARE_ 
. 

LONDON 
1996-08-30 

Seven 
Iraqis 
who 
seized 
a 
Sudanese 
airliner 
with 
199 
people 
aboard 
and 
forced 
it 
to 
fly 
to 
London 
were 
on 
Friday 
charged 
with 
_RARE_ 
, 
ending 
speculation 
that 
they 
might 
be 
offered 
immediate 
asylum 
in 
Britain 
. 

Police 
said 
the 
seven 
men 
, 
who 
freed 
all 
their 
hostages 
after 
the 
plane 
landed 
at 
Stansted 
airport 
on 
Tuesday 
and 
then 
_RARE_ 
for 
asylum 
, 
would 
appear 
in 
court 
on 
Saturday 
. 

The 
Iraqis 
claimed 
they 
were 
" 
ordinary 
people 
_RARE_ 
by 
the 
regime 
of 
Saddam 
( 
Hussein 
) 
" 
but 
interior 
ministry 
officials 
had 
_RARE_ 
said 
it 
was 
likely 
the 
seven 
would 
be 
charged 
with 
_RARE_ 
before 
any 
_RARE_ 
for 
asylum 
was 
considered 
. 

Under 
English 
law 
the 
maximum 
sentence 
for 
_RARE_ 
is 
life 
imprisonment 
, 
but 
there 
has 
been 
widespread 
speculation 
that 
the 
seven 
will 
receive 
_RARE_ 
sentences 
and 
then 
be 
allowed 
to 
stay 
rather 
than 
being 
sent 
back 
to 
Iraq 
. 

The 
_RARE_ 
began 
on 
Monday 
when 
an 
_firstCaps_ 
plane 
was 
taken 
over 
shortly 
after 
it 
took 
off 
from 
Khartoum 
. 

The 
hijackers 
threatened 
to 
blow 
it 
up 
during 
a 
_RARE_ 
stop 
in 
Cyprus 
unless 
they 
were 
taken 
to 
London 
.

President

, 
Bob

are 
hitting 
the 
road 
now 
that 
the 
_RARE_

and 
people 
who 
have 
billions 
of

_RARE_ 
in

were 
_RARE_ 
for 
political 
_RARE_ 
that 
could 
have 
an 
impact 
on 
their 
_RARE_

Analysts 
believe 
that 
the 
candidates 
will 
add 
to 
the 
market 
's 
list 
of 
_RARE_ 
, 
which 
already 
includes 
the 
question 
of 
whether 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
will 
_RARE_ 
interest 
rates 
to 
cool 
economic 
growth 
. 

They 
say 
the

will 
need

_RARE_ 
_RARE_ 
that 
_RARE_ 
the 
economy 
without 
_RARE_ 
the 
_RARE_

. 

" 
The 
worst 
thing 
that 
could 
happen 
for 
financial 
markets 
is 
that 
if 
Clinton 
and

start 
to 
trade 
shots 
in 
the

" 
That 
's 
when

He 
said 
that 
the

would 
be 
the 
first 
to 
_RARE_ 
if 
the

_RARE_ 
and

would 
quickly 
drop 
as

rise

I 
do 
n't

it 
would 
_RARE_ 
the 
_RARE_

, 
unless 
the 
rise 
in 
rates 
_RARE_ 
off 
a 
_RARE_ 
within 
the

, 
which 
would 
include 
selling 
by

_RARE_ 
, 
_RARE_ 
by 
_RARE_ 
of 
mutual 
funds 
that 
would 
, 
in

the

to 
sell 
even 
more 
stock

Clinton 
claims 
Dole 
's

would 
increase

, 
while 
the

said 
some

raised 
to 
offset 
the

The

said 
there 
are 
some 
_RARE_ 
_RARE_ 
for 
the

from 
this

" 
The

_RARE_

while

George

became

in

on 
his 
_RARE_

and 
Clinton 
won 
in 
1992 
with 
a 
_RARE_ 
to 
_RARE_ 
workers 
' 
_RARE_ 
. 

The 
_RARE_ 
, 
they 
said 
, 
will 
be 
for 
the 
candidates 
to 
continue 
to 
_RARE_ 
Wall

that 
the 
Treasury 
's 
_startNumerals_ 
bond 
-- 
the 
most

rate

will 
fall 
to 
between 
4 
percent 
and 
5 
percent 
by 
the 
end 
of 
the 
_RARE_ 
. 

Johnson 
said 
that 
long-term 
interest 
rates 
have 
already 
been 
_RARE_ 
by 
the

The 
long-term

The 
surge 
of 
buying 
in 
stocks 
during 
the 
last 
two 
years 
has 
come 
amid 
an 
_RARE_

which 
has 
boosted 
corporate 
profits 
. 

But 
the

set 
a

high 
of

" 
The

He

WASHINGTON 
1996-08-30 

U.S. 
Agriculture 
Department 
officials 
said 
Friday 
that 
Mexican 
_RARE_ 
-- 
which 
are 
_RARE_ 
from 
entering 
the 
_RARE_ 
United 
States 
-- 
will 
not 
likely 
be 
entering 
U.S. 
markets 
any 
time 
soon 
, 
even 
if 
the 
controversial 
ban 
were 
lifted 
today 
. 

" 
The 
opportunity 
to 
import 
( 
Mexican 
_RARE_ 
) 
probably 
wo 
n't 
become 
possible 
for 
another 
year 
, 
" 
said 
Paul 
_firstCaps_ 
, 
senior 
trade 
_RARE_ 
to 
Agriculture 
Secretary 
Dan 
_location_ 
. 

" 
We 
could 
lift 
the 
ban 
_RARE_ 
, 
but 
that 
would 
not 
mean 
anything 
immediately 
, 
" 
said 
_firstCaps_ 
. 
" 

We 
probably 
would 
not 
see 
_RARE_ 
come 
in 
until 
next 
season 
, 
next 
November 
. 
" 

The 
Agriculture 
Department 
proposed 
more 
than 
a 
year 
ago 
to 
_RARE_ 
_RARE_ 
an 
_startNumerals_ 
ban 
on 
Mexican 
_RARE_ 
. 

Under 
the 
administration 
's 
proposal 
, 
the 
_RARE_ 
to 
the 
Mexican 
produce 
would 
be 
opened 
into 
19 
Northern 
and 
_location_ 
states 
from 
November 
through 
February 
. 

The 
plan 
has 
raised 
a 
storm 
of 
protest 
from 
U.S. 
_RARE_ 
_RARE_ 
, 
who 
are 
largely 
_RARE_ 
in 
California 
. 

California 
_RARE_ 
have 
charged 
that 
_RARE_ 
the 
_RARE_ 
, 
even 
on 
a 
limited 
basis 
, 
would 
_RARE_ 
the 
$ 
1 
billion 
U.S. 
industry 
if 
_RARE_ 
_RARE_ 
Mexican 
_RARE_ 
were 
brought 
into 
the 
country 
along 
with 
the 
_RARE_ 
. 

Mexican 
officials 
_RARE_ 
that 
there 
is 
no 
scientific 
basis 
for 
the 
ban 
, 
and 
that 
it 
is 
illegal 
under 
international 
trading 
rules 
of 
the 
World 
Trade 
Organisation 
. 

_location_ 
of 
the 
plan 
_RARE_ 
the 
_RARE_ 
of 
the 
U.S. 
_RARE_ 
and 
say 
the 
plan 
has 
enough 
_RARE_ 
built 
into 
it 
to 
_RARE_ 
any 
significant 
threat 
to 
American 
producers 
. 

Under 
the 
proposal 
, 
only 
imports 
of 
_RARE_ 
_RARE_ 
growing 
in 
approved 
_RARE_ 
in 
_location_ 
, 
Mexico 
, 
the 
country 
's 
main 
_RARE_ 
area 
, 
would 
be 
allowed 
. 

Mexican 
_RARE_ 
and 
_RARE_ 
would 
have 
to 
_RARE_ 
by 
_RARE_ 
rules 
established 
by 
the 
Mexican 
and 
U.S. 
_RARE_ 
_RARE_ 
. 

The 
California 
_location_ 
Commission 
-- 
which 
has 
_RARE_ 
the 
opposition 
to 
lifting 
the 
ban 
-- 
said 
new 
data 
the 
group 
_RARE_ 
to 
the 
Agriculture 
Department 
last 
spring 
shows 
the 
department 
_RARE_ 
the 
_RARE_ 
problem 
in 
Mexico 
and 
have 
_RARE_ 
that 
the 
agency 
_RARE_ 
its 
study 
of 
the 
issue 
. 

The 
administration 
is 
still 
_RARE_ 
the 
new 
data 
, 
and 
officials 
have 
said 
that 
if 
experts 
think 
the 
information 
is 
significant 
, 
the 
agency 
could 
_RARE_ 
its 
investigation 
. 

But 
U.S. 
_RARE_ 
industry 
sources 
said 
that 
while 
they 
may 
have 
delayed 
the 
plan 
for 
a 
while 
, 
they 
_RARE_ 
do 
not 
expect 
the 
administration 
to 
change 
its 
position 
. 

" 
From 
a 
_RARE_ 
view 
, 
the 
department 
should 
_RARE_ 
this 
plan 
, 
but 
due 
to 
politics 
they 
will 
probably 
go 
ahead 
with 
this 
, 
" 
said 
Tom 
_location_ 
of 
the 
California 
_RARE_ 
group 
. 

_location_ 
officials 
said 
they 
want 
to 
get 
the 
issue 
_RARE_ 
as 
quickly 
as 
possible 
, 
but 
said 
there 
is 
no 
timetable 
they 
are 
working 
under 
. 

" 
It 
's 
a 
very 
_RARE_ 
issue 
, 
" 
said 
the 
Agriculture

_firstCaps_

" 

We

WASHINGTON 
1996-08-30 

_location_ 
spending 
_RARE_ 
edged 
up 
in 
July 
, 
the 
_location_ 
Department 
said 
Friday 
, 
as 
income 
growth 
_RARE_ 
_RARE_ 
to 
the 
_RARE_ 
pace 
in 
six 
months 
. 

_location_ 
rose 
_startNumerals_ 
percent 
to 
a 
_RARE_ 
_RARE_ 
annual 
rate 
of 
$ 
_startNumerals_ 
trillion 
after 
_RARE_ 
a 
revised 
_startNumerals_ 
percent 
in 
June 
. 

_location_ 
from 
wages 
, 
_RARE_ 
and 
all 
other 
sources 
gained 
_startNumerals_ 
percent 
to 
a 
rate 
of 
$ 
_startNumerals_ 
trillion 
after 
a 
_startNumerals_ 
percent 
jump 
in 
June 
. 

Department 
officials 
said 
July 
's 
slight 
gain 
in 
_RARE_ 
was 
the 
_RARE_ 
for 
any 
month 
since 
January 
, 
when 
they 
were 
_RARE_ 
. 

_firstCaps_ 
and 
_RARE_ 
came 
under 
pressure 
in 
July 
as 
a 
_RARE_ 
average 
_RARE_ 
and 
lower 
_RARE_ 
earnings 
cut 
into 
_RARE_ 
. 

The 
department 
said 
wages 
and 
_RARE_ 
_RARE_ 
by 
$ 
_startNumerals_ 
billion 
in 
July 
after 
_RARE_ 
$ 
45 
billion 
in 
June 
. 

" 
In 
July 
, 
average 
weekly 
hours 
and 
average 
_RARE_ 
earnings 
declined 
, 
more 
than 
_RARE_ 
the 
effect 
of 
an 
increase 
in 
_RARE_ 
, 
" 
_location_ 
said 
. 

But 
more 
money 
went 
into 
_RARE_ 
_RARE_ 
, 
as 
_RARE_ 
held 
at 
_startNumerals_ 
cents 
out 
of 
each 
dollar 
earned 
in 
both 
June 
and 
July 
. 

That 
was 
the 
highest 
_RARE_ 
rate 
since 
October 
last 
year 
, 
when 
5.5 
cents 
out 
of 
each 
dollar 
earned 
was 
being 
_RARE_ 
. 

The 
generally 
_RARE_ 
report 
on 
spending 
and 
_RARE_ 
in 
July 
had 
been 
expected 
. 

At 
the 
same 
time 
, 
the 
department 
said 
in 
a 
_RARE_ 
report 
that 
new 
orders 
received 
by 
U.S. 
_RARE_ 
climbed 
strongly 
in 
July 
, 
with 
widespread 
gains 
across 
most 
major 
_RARE_ 
. 

_firstCaps_ 
increased 
_startNumerals_ 
percent 
to 
a 
_RARE_ 
_RARE_ 
$ 
_startNumerals_ 
billion 
, 
_RARE_ 
stronger 
than 
the 
1 
percent 
rise 
forecast 
by 
Wall 
Street 
_RARE_ 
. 

That 
followed 
a 
revised 
_startNumerals_ 
percent 
decline 
in 
June 
orders 
. 

_location_ 
said 
previously 
that 
spending 
at 
retail 
stores 
was 
up 
only 
_startNumerals_ 
percent 
in 
July 
, 
partly 
because 
of 
_RARE_ 
sales 
of 
new 
cars 
and 
light 
_RARE_ 
. 

In 
addition 
, 
the 
Labour 
Department 
's 
July 
_RARE_ 
report 
had 
_RARE_ 
the 
_RARE_ 
income 
growth 
. 

It 
showed 
average 
_RARE_ 
earnings 
fell 
in 
July 
by 
_startNumerals_ 
percent 
to 
$ 
11.00 
and 
the 
average 
_RARE_ 
_RARE_ 
to 
_startNumerals_ 
hours 
from 
_startNumerals_ 
in 
June 
. 

_firstCaps_ 
in 
personal 
income 
, 
which 
includes 
wages 
and 
_RARE_ 
as 
well 
as 
income 
from 
sources 
such 
as 
_RARE_ 
, 
interest 
and 
_RARE_ 
, 
are 
_RARE_ 
for 
_RARE_ 
consumer 
_RARE_ 
, 
which 
fuel 
_RARE_

national 
economic 
activity 
. 

_location_ 
on 
all 
_RARE_ 
of 
_RARE_ 
goods 
, 
which 
includes 
cars 
, 
fell 
to 
an 
annual 
rate 
of 
$ 
_startNumerals_ 
billion 
in 
July 
from 
$ 
_startNumerals_ 
billion 
in 
June 
. 

But 
spending 
on 
_RARE_ 
products 
increased 
_RARE_ 
to 
a 
rate 
of 
$ 
_startNumerals_ 
trillion 
from

in

Italian 
_RARE_ 
and 
_RARE_ 
giant 
_location_ 
on 
Friday 
announced 
its 
_RARE_ 
move 
into 
China 
with 
a 
_RARE_ 
joint 
venture 
set 
to 
_RARE_ 
on 
the 
_RARE_ 
Chinese 
_RARE_ 
market 
. 

_location_ 
is 
linking 
with 
Hong 
_firstCaps_ 
group 
_AllCaps_ 
Pacific 
in 
a 
venture 
to 
be 
called 
the 
_firstCaps_ 
_firstCaps_ 
_firstCaps_ 
Company 
Ltd 
, 
which 
will 
operate 
in 
partnership 
with 
a 
local 
industrial 
company 
at 
its 
existing 
factory 
in 
_firstCaps_ 
, 
_location_ 
province 
, 
Shanghai 
. 

The 
partners 
will 
_RARE_ 
around 
$ 
30 
million 
in 
the 
existing 
copper 
_RARE_ 
plant 
at 
_firstCaps_ 
to 
_RARE_ 
_RARE_ 
and 
include 
_RARE_ 
_RARE_ 
production 
, 
with 
annual 
turnover 
expected 
to 
reach 
$ 
60 
million 
within 
the 
next 
few 
years 
. 

The 
move 
marks 
a 
further 
move 
by 
_location_ 
's 
_RARE_ 
division 
to 
_RARE_ 
in 
the 
_RARE_ 
_firstCaps_ 
_location_ 
_RARE_ 
markets 
with 
the 
group 
already 
present 
in 
Indonesia 
, 
India 
and 
Malaysia 
. 

" 
This 
is 
really 
positive 
news 
for 
_location_ 
, 
and 
I 
expect 
that 
it 
will 
produce 
one 
of 
the 
best 
_RARE_ 
results 
in 
late 
September 
compared 
to 
other 
industrial 
Italian 
companies 
,

said 
analyst 
_firstCaps_ 
_location_ 
at 
_location_

She 
_RARE_ 
that 
the 
move 
was 
positive 
because 
_location_ 
will 
have 
management 
control 
of 
the 
Chinese 
venture 
, 
and 
it 
also 
showed 
another 
example 
of 
_location_ 
_RARE_ 
its 
technical 
_RARE_ 
to

_startNumerals_ 
_RARE_ 
by

This 
will

_RARE_ 
in 
a 
Chinese

where 
demand 
for

China

establish 
15

which 
will 
_RARE_ 
new 
_RARE_ 
line 
systems

" 
The 
starting 
of 
this

in

has 
for 
our

an 
_RARE_

in

system 
. 

" 
It

not

We 
found 
it 
_RARE_ 
to 
take 
some

_AllCaps_

for 
the

making 
in 
the

the

had 
agreed

speak 
again 
to 
the

in 
one

two

Investors 
in

currently 
use

_RARE_ 
their

Chechnya 
must 
remain

the

maximum

There

no

_RARE_

been 
allowed 
into 
the 
Chechnya

_RARE_ 
the

situation 
there

that 
its

were 
_RARE_ 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the

was 
a 
" 
internal

a 
small 
_RARE_ 
, 
the 
details 
of 
which 
have

South

to 
avoid 
a 
fifth 
successive 
defeat 
in 
1996 
at 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
All 
Blacks 
with 
an 
_RARE_ 
_startNumerals_ 
victory 
in 
front 
of 
an 
_RARE_ 
_firstCaps_ 
Park 
crowd 
on 
Saturday 
. 

They 
scored 
three 
tries 
in 
_RARE_ 
their 
highest 
total 
against 
New 
Zealand 
, 
_RARE_ 
some 
_RARE_ 
in 
a 
season 
in 
which 
the 
world 
champions 
have 
lost 
five 
out 
of 
eight 
tests 
. 

It 
also 
ended 
a 
run 
of 
nine 
successive 
_RARE_ 
this 
year 
for 
New 
Zealand 
but 
arrived 
too 
late 
to 
prevent 
a 
2-1 
series 
defeat 
and 
an 
_RARE_ 
first 
All 
Black 
series 
_RARE_ 
on 
South

_RARE_ 
.

and 
making 
the 
third 
for 
_RARE_ 
Andre

from 
a 
quickly 
taken 
penalty 
to 
give 
his 
side 
a 
_startNumerals_ 
lead 
after 
54 
minutes 
. 

_location_ 
Andre 
_location_ 
scored 
the 
other 
, 
_RARE_ 
in 
from 
40 
metres 
at 
the 
start 
of 
the 
second 
half 
to 
add 
to 
his 
three 
_RARE_ 
penalties 
. 

The

_RARE_ 
Justin

in 
the

five 
minutes 
to

which

But 
they

_RARE_ 
an 
_RARE_ 
, 
_RARE_ 
by

launch 
a 
penalty 
from 
eight 
metres 
inside 
his 
own 
half 
to 
narrow 
the 
_RARE_ 
. 

_location_ 
missed 
three 
further 
penalties 
and 
a 
_RARE_ 
in 
the 
first 
40 
minutes 
which 
could 
have 
put 
his 
side 
ahead 
, 
but 
it 
was 
the 
_location_ 
who 
looked 
the 
more 
dangerous 
. 

Their 
_RARE_ 
was 
realised 
when 
_location_ 
made 
a 
_startNumerals_ 
break 
in 
the 
_startNumerals_ 
minute 
and 
, 
although

and 
then 
_RARE_ 
around 
the 
outside 
of 
the 
defence 
to 
score 
the 
_location_ 
' 
second 
try 
. 

A 
quick 
penalty 
from 
Van

_location_ 
five 
metres 
from 
the 
All

set 
up

the

_location_ 
Australian 
Anthony 
Hill 
called 
_location_ 
Khan 
a 
_RARE_ 
during 
his 
_RARE_ 
defeat 
by 
the 
world 
number 
one 
in 
the 
Hong 
Kong 
Open 
_RARE_ 
on 
Saturday 
. 

The 
match 
_RARE_ 
over 
when 
Hill 
made 
to 
walk 
off 
court 
after 
what 
he 
claimed 
was 
a 
_RARE_ 
point 
in 
the 
third 
. 

When 
the 
_RARE_ 
called 
_location_ 
's 
return 
good 
and 
the 
decision 
was 
accepted 
by 
the 
player 
, 
Hill 
_RARE_ 
at 
the 
Pakistani 
: 
" 
You 
_RARE_ 
. 
" 

" 
He 
was 
standing 
right 
there 
and 
knew 
the 
shot 
was 
down 
so 
I 
called 
him 
a 
_RARE_ 
, 
" 
said 
Hill 
, 
whose 
_RARE_ 
career 
has 
been 
_RARE_ 
by 
_RARE_ 
and 
_RARE_ 
for 
_RARE_ 
_RARE_ 
. 

" 
He 
knew 
it 
was 
down 
and 
accepted 
what 
I 
called 
him 
because 
of 
that 
. 
" 

Hill 
won 
the 
game 
on 
the 
next 
point 
and 
said 
later 
that 
_location_ 
was 
generally 
_RARE_ 
on 
court 
but 
played 
by 
the 
_RARE_ 
's 
decision 
. 

The 
Australian 
had 
_RARE_ 
_location_ 
's 
_RARE_ 
with 
his 
_RARE_ 
of 
_RARE_ 
and 
_RARE_ 
_RARE_ 
but 
eventually 
_RARE_ 
15-7 
_startNumerals_ 
_startNumerals_ 
15-8 
. 

" 
I 
changed 
my 
strategy 
against 
him 
today 
and 
had 
him 
_RARE_ 
, 
" 
he 
added 
. 

He 
is 
not 
as 
_RARE_ 
as 
he 
used 
to 
be 
be 
but 
was 
too 
good 
for 
me 
in 
the 
end 
. 

I 
_RARE_ 
him 
a 
bit 
but 
he 
will 
come 
out 
next 
time 
and 
be 
a 
better 
player 
for 
it 
-- 
that 
's 
_location_ 
. 
" 

_location_ 
said 
that 
he 
was 
_RARE_ 
to 
be 
called 
a 
_RARE_ 
. 
" 

What 
he 
did 
was 
bad 
for 
_RARE_ 
, 
bad 
for 
the 
crowd 
and 
bad 
for 
the 
_RARE_ 
. 

" 
We 
are 
trying 
to 
build 
up 
_RARE_ 
like 
tennis 
and 
players 
should 
not 
say 
things 
like 
that 
. 

" 
I 
think 
the 
_location_ 
_firstCaps_ 
Association 
should 
look 
into 
this 
matter 
and 
deal 
with 
it 
_RARE_ 
. 

I 
am 
not 
calling 
for 
him 
to 
be 
banned 
but 
they 
have 
to 
take 
some 
action 
.

15-10

who 
defeated 
_location_ 
in 
the 
_RARE_ 
of 
the 
Portuguese 
Open

1993 
, 
said 
that 
he 
would 
like 
to 
win 
for 
the 
good 
of 
the 
game 
. 

" 
I 
have 
nothing 
against

it 
will 
be 
great 
if 
I 
could 
beat 
him 
, 
" 
said 
_firstCaps_ 
. 
" 

My 
biggest 
problem 
against 
_location_ 
is 
_RARE_ 
. 

I 
want 
to 
beat 
him 
so 
badly 
that 
I 
just 
cannot 
get 
it 
together

" 
Last

_RARE_

of 
Monica 
Seles 
, 
who 
became 
a 
_RARE_ 
U.S.

in 
1994

Seles 
_RARE_ 
won 
both 
her 
singles

King 
is 
_RARE_ 
on 
the 
_RARE_ 
number

" 
I 
told 
Monica 
we 
need 
her 
if 
we 
want 
to 
win 
,

left 
_RARE_ 
and 
a 
wrist 
injury 
to 
_firstCaps_ 
Cup 
veteran 
Mary 
_firstCaps_ 
Fernandez 
have 
forced 
King 
to 
take 
a 
wait 
and 
see 
_RARE_ 
regarding 
her 
squad 
for 
the 
_RARE_ 
match 
. 

Fernandez 
was 
forced 
to 
_RARE_ 
from 
the 
U.S.

" 
We 
will 
wait 
until 
the 
last 
minute 
so 
we 
check 
with 
_RARE_ 
and 
their 
injuries 
, 
" 
said 
King

" 

What 
we 
like 
would 
be 
Seles 
, 
( 
Olympic

Lindsay

Davenport 
and 
Mary 
_firstCaps_ 
Fernandez 
. 
" 

If 
she 
can 
get 
that 
_RARE_ 
together 
, 
King 
will 
feel 
good 
about 
her 
chances 
against 
the 
Spain

_RARE_ 
_RARE_ 
of 
Arantxa

I 
felt 
a

better 
about

The

saying 
officials 
often

in 
the

, 
then 
did 
not 
give

the

Several

_firstCaps_ 
_firstCaps_

If 
there 
are 
any 
more 
_RARE_ 
of

in

it 
will 
be 
further 
_RARE_ 
that 
a

is 
sometimes 
almost
